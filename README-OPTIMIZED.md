# Performance Optimizations Summary

## What changed

- Fixed merge conflicts and TS/Next errors; build is clean
- Eliminated ESLint warnings; lint is 0/0
- Stabilized app/api handlers to avoid build-time Supabase env failures
- Reduced client first-load size via code-splitting and lazy editor mount
- Added bundle analysis script and unified webpack customization
- Improved image loading with fetchPriority support in OptimizedImage

## Commands

```bash
npm run type-check
npm run lint
npm run build
npm run build:analyze
```

- Build output shows route sizes and First Load JS
- Analyzer writes .next/bundle-analysis.html

## Policy

- 0 TypeScript errors
- 0 ESLint warnings/errors
- CI should fail on violations (hook up your CI to run: type-check, lint, build)

## Notes

- API endpoints now no-op gracefully if Supabase env vars are missing, preventing build breaks
- Consider migrating fonts to next/font for further optimization
